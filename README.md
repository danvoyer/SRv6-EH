Abstract

   The network operator and vendor community has clearly indicated that
   IPv6 header insertion is useful and required.  This is notably the
   case when the entire journey of the packet remains in its source
   domain.  In such a context, it does not matter where the extension
   header is inserted.  The source domain may decide to place the IPv6
   extension header insertion where it suits its best: at the source of
   the packet or at any midpoint within the source domain.
